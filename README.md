## Reproducibility declaration

This is a repository containing the data and code for reproducing results from:    

> Yang, Y.,  Parker, T., Macleod, M., Sena, E., Lagisz, M., & Nakagawa, S. (2025). Real-world research often requires enormous sample sizes: A call for top-down science policies supporting grassroots big-team science initiatives.

## Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

- Dat

- Fig

- R

### `Dat` folder

The `Dat` folder includes the datasets that are necessary for reproducing all analyses and figures reported in our paper. The data are in the formats `.rda` and `.csv`.


**Credit:**

The datasets were originally compiled by:

> Bartoš, F., Maier, M., Wagenmakers, E. J., Nippold, F., Doucouliagos, H., Ioannidis, J. P., ... & Stanley, T. D. (2024). Footprint of publication selection bias on meta‐analyses in medicine, environmental sciences, psychology, and economics. Research Synthesis Methods, 15(3), 500-511..

Owing to journals’ mandatory open data policies and the widespread adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data-sharing principles, we could easily find and re-use these publicly accessible datasets.


### `Fig`

The `Figure` folder includes the Figure 1 (based on `R` code) reported in the paper. It also includes two supplementary figures.


### `R` folder

The `R` folder includes the `R` scripts that reproduce all results and figures. 

The scripts are formatted in Rmarkdown (`Rmd`).

- `Analytic_script3.Rmd.Rmd`

It is a stand-alone `Rmd` that contains both the Method section and `R` code replicating all analyses and results (e.g., figures reported in `Fig`)

`environmental-evidence.csl` and `references.bib` are not involved in any analyses and are only used to generate `HTML`.
